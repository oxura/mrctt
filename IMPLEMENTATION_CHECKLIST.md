### Integration Tests (Backend)
- [ ] Auth flows (register â†’ login â†’ refresh â†’ logout)
- [ ] Tenant isolation (verify RLS policies work)
- [ ] RBAC enforcement (role-based endpoint access)
- [ ] Rate limiting (hit limits, verify 429)
- [ ] CSRF protection (test exempt vs protected)

### E2E Tests (Frontend)
- [ ] Registration â†’ Onboarding â†’ Dashboard
- [ ] Login â†’ Create Lead â†’ View Lead
- [ ] Kanban drag-and-drop â†’ Status update
- [ ] Create Product â†’ Assign to Lead
